Regarding the issue of the protagonist model disappearing, you need to set it manually. First, locate the Noah model, the path is MultimediaProject-master\Assets\Art\Characters\Model\Noah, where you can see the missing parts in the image. Next, find the material, the path is MultimediaProject-master\Assets\GLTFUtility-master\Materials\Built-in. Based on the image, simply place the materials into the corresponding slots.
The second issue is with the video clip. First, find the VideoPlayer of the StartMenu in the hierarchy. You will see an empty slot for the video clip. Then, go to MultimediaProject-master\Assets\UI and find the time-space rotation video. Simply drag it into the empty slot, and it will be set.
